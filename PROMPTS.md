## 🎯 Problem Interpretation

I interpreted the task as a **full-stack design challenge** where clarity, architecture, and delivery speed matter more than building a feature-heavy app.  
To stand out, I focused on:
- Strong backend modularity (using **Spring Boot** instead of Node.js)  
- Clean React-based frontend with state-managed cart  
- Clear separation of layers and transparent documentation  
- Inclusion of **AI prompt logs** for originality and transparency

## 🧠 Key Prompts Used

Prompt 1: "Create an E-Commerce Website using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL."  
Prompt 2: "Generate architecture documentation and modular structure for submission."  
Prompt 3: "Make it unique with prompt logs and documentation files."  
Prompt 4: "Guide me step-by-step to push it on GitHub using Git Bash."  
Prompt 5: "Polish the README with professional formatting and tech badges."  
Prompt 6: "Explain how to structure and document this project to stand out from 800 candidates."
